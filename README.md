Slicing:
========

### Tasks need to be done:
- make matcher either for every type of node which is using a variable, or a generalized one.
- handle continue and break statements in a loop, regarding data dependence
- correct the data dependence builder algorithm when dealing with nested CompoundStatements in a loop
- add more tests

### Aspects of performance:
 - what should be stored
 - how should it be stored (maybe JSON)

#### Program structure:
 - Get source file, and line no.
 - Parse AST via ASTMatchers and create the Statement graph.
 - Insert data dependence edges to it.
 - Compute slice regarding the input line no via a breadth-first search.
 - Print (prettily) the slice. (currently it's a GraphViz dot dump.)



## Setup:

1. Download and build the x64 version of `llvm` and `clang` for Windows (Visual Studio) @ https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html using `cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -Thost=x64 ..\llvm` (if 16 doesn't work, try a different constant, e.g. 15 or 17).
2. Launch `LLVM.sln`  generated by the command above in VS and build the subgroup `Clang libraries`.
3. Launch `slicer.sln` and open the project `Properties`. Change all paths from `C:\Users\Denis\llvm\*` to `<llvm folder>\*` in Additional Include Directories and Additional Library Directories.
